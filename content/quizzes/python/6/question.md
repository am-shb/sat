What is the output of the following code?

```python
age = 21
height = 176
if age > 18 and height >= 150:
print("You are eligible to take this ride!")
elif age <= 18:
print("Sorry, you are too young to take this ride!")
else:
print("Sorry, you don't meet the height requirements for this ride!")
```
